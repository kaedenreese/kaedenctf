CTF Datapack for Minecraft

This is an effort to create an easy-to-use datapack for Minecraft 1.17.1+ (and potentially 1.13+, but I will not be doing exhaustive testing). This readme has a list of project goals and features I'd like to eventually implement into the datapack. The overall goals are ease of use and fun. Beyond that, specifics will be listed below.

INSTALLATION

To install this datapack, simply take the entire downloaded ZIP file and place it into your world/datapacks folder without extracting it. Then you need to restart whatever hosting environment you are using (either remote hosting, local hosting, or restarting Minecraft for a single player experience, though this datapack is designed for more than one player).

PROJECT FEATURES (v0.1)

- Functions to create flag spawning points
- Functions to create respawn points for team players
- Changing class via inventory
- Selecting teams via inventory
- Random team selection, manual team selection, and possibly "Mixer Mode" where a captain selects their teammates
- Setting game conditions for each map, from time of day to weather

LONG TERM FEATURES

- More than two teams
